# ATTENDANCE SHEET MAKER
The problem is the time wasted by the teacher every morning and every end of the period to check the no. of the children present in the class.

## PROPOSED SOLUTION
A system that will recognize the faces of children present by facial recognition and make a list of students by the names corresponding to the images of their faces
